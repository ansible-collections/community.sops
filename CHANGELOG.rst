v1.7.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Bugfix and feature release to fix installation issues with SOPS 3.9.0.

Minor Changes
-------------

- sops vars plugin - allow to configure the valid extensions with an ``ansible.cfg`` entry or with an environment variable (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.sops/pull/185).

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix RPM URL for the 3.9.0 release (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.sops/pull/188).

v1.6.7
======

Release Summary
---------------

Bugfix release.

Bugfixes
--------

- sops_encrypt - ensure that output-type is set to ``yaml`` when the file extension ``.yml`` is used. Now both ``.yaml`` and ``.yml`` files use the SOPS ``--output-type=yaml`` formatting (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.sops/issues/164).

v1.6.6
======

Release Summary
---------------

Make fully compatible with and test against sops 3.8.0.

Bugfixes
--------

- Fix RPM URL for the 3.8.0 release (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.sops/pull/161).

v1.6.5
======

Release Summary
---------------

Make compatible with and test against sops 3.8.0-rc.1.

Bugfixes
--------

- Avoid pre-releases when picking the latest version when using the GitHub API method (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.sops/pull/159).
- Fix changed DEB and RPM URLs for 3.8.0 and its prerelease(s) (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.sops/pull/159).

v1.6.4
======

Release Summary
---------------

Maintenance/bugfix release for the move of sops to the new `getsops GitHub organization <https://github.com/getsops>`__.

Bugfixes
--------

- install role - fix ``sops_github_latest_detection=latest-release``, which broke due to sops moving to another GitHub organization (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.sops/pull/151).

v1.6.3
======

Release Summary
---------------

Maintenance release with updated documentation.

From this version on, community.sops is using the new `Ansible semantic markup
<https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_modules_documenting.html#semantic-markup-within-module-documentation>`__
in its documentation. If you look at documentation with the ansible-doc CLI tool
from ansible-core before 2.15, please note that it does not render the markup
correctly. You should be still able to read it in most cases, but you need
ansible-core 2.15 or later to see it as it is intended. Alternatively you can
look at `the devel docsite <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/collections/community/sops/>`__
for the rendered HTML version of the documentation of the latest release.

Known Issues
------------

- Ansible markup will show up in raw form on ansible-doc text output for ansible-core before 2.15. If you have trouble deciphering the documentation markup, please upgrade to ansible-core 2.15 (or newer), or read the HTML documentation on https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/collections/community/sops/.

v1.6.2
======

Release Summary
---------------

Maintenance release.

Bugfixes
--------

- install role - make sure that the ``pkg_mgr`` fact is definitely available when installing on ``localhost``. This can improve error messages in some cases (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.sops/issues/145, https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.sops/pull/146).

v1.6.1
======

Release Summary
---------------

Maintenance release.

Bugfixes
--------

- action plugin helper - fix handling of deprecations for ansible-core 2.14.2 (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.sops/pull/136).
- various plugins - remove unnecessary imports (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.sops/pull/133).

v1.6.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Feature release improving the installation role.

Minor Changes
-------------

- install role - add ``sops_github_latest_detection`` option that allows to configure which method to use for detecting the latest release on GitHub. By default (``auto``) first tries to retrieve a list of recent releases using the API, and if that fails due to rate limiting, tries to obtain the latest GitHub release from a semi-documented URL (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.sops/pull/133).
- install role - add ``sops_github_token`` option to allow passing a GitHub token. This can for example be used to avoid rate limits when using the role in GitHub Actions (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.sops/pull/132).
- install role - implement another method to determine the latest release on GitHub than using the GitHub API, which can make installation fail due to rate-limiting (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.sops/pull/131).

v1.5.0
======

Release Summary
---------------

Feature release.

Minor Changes
-------------

- Automatically install GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) in execution environments. To install Mozilla sops a manual step needs to be added to the EE definition, see the collection's documentation for details (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.sops/pull/98).

New Playbooks
-------------

- community.sops.install - Installs sops and GNU Privacy Guard on all remote hosts
- community.sops.install_localhost - Installs sops and GNU Privacy Guard on localhost

New Roles
---------

- community.sops.install - Install Mozilla sops
