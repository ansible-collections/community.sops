bugfixes:
  - "all modules and plugins - the default of ``enable_local_keyservice`` changed from ``false`` to ``true``, and explicitly setting it to ``false`` now passes ``--enable-local-keyservice=false``.
     SOPS' default has always been ``true``, and when setting this option to ``true`` so far it resulted in passing ``--enable-local-keyservice``, which is equivalent to ``--enable-local-keyservice=true`` and had no effect.
     This means that from now on, setting ``enable_local_keyservice`` explicitly to ``false`` has an effect. If ``enable_local_keyservice`` was not set before, or was set to ``true``, nothing will change
