known_issues:
  - "When using the ``community.sops.load_vars`` with ansible-core 2.20, note that the deprecation of ``INJECT_FACTS_AS_VARS``
     causes deprecation warnings to be shown every time a variable loaded with ``community.sops.load_vars`` is used.
     This is due to ansible-core deprecating ``INJECT_FACTS_AS_VARS`` without providing an alternative for modules like
     ``community.sops.load_vars`` to use. If you do not like these deprecation warnings, you have to explicitly set
     ``INJECT_FACTS_AS_VARS`` to ``true``. **DO NOT** change the use of SOPS encrypted variables to ``ansible_facts``.
     The situation will hopefully improve in ansible-core 2.21 through the promised API that allows action plugins to
     set variables; community.sops will adapt to use it, which will make the warning go away.
     (The API was originally promised for ansible-core 2.20, but then delayed.)"
