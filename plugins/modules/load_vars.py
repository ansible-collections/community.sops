short_description: Load sops-encrypted variables from files, dynamically within a task
version_added: '0.1.0'
description:
  - Loads sops-encrypted YAML/JSON variables dynamically from a file during task runtime.
  - To assign included variables to a different host than C(inventory_hostname),
    use C(delegate_to) and set C(delegate_facts=yes).
options:
  file:
    description:
      - The file name from which variables should be loaded.
      - If the path is relative, it will look for the file in C(vars/) subdirectory of a role or relative to playbook.
    type: path
  name:
    description:
      - The name of a variable into which assign the included vars.
      - If omitted (C(null)) they will be made top level vars.
    type: str
  static:
    description:
      - If set to C(false), the contents of the file will be loaded as real variables. This means that Jinja2 expressions
        will be interpreted on usage of the variables.
      - If set to the default value C(true), all strings will be interpreted as strings and will not be templated,
        neither during loading nor during usage.
      - Please note that C(false) is not officially supported by Ansible and is achieved by hacks. We try to make sure
        that it works for all supported versions of Ansible.
      - "NOTE: If set to C(false), DO NOT register the result of the task, or use this task for a loop!
         This breaks the functionality somehow."
    type: bool
    default: true
